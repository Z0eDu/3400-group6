# Lab 3: FPGA Video Controller and Sound Generation

### Objectives
* Take at least two external inputs to the FPGA and display them on a screen
* React to an external input to the FPGA of their choice and generate a short ‘tune’ consisting of at least three tones to a speaker via an 8-bit DAC

## Grading Criteria
1 point: Reading external inputs to FPGA  
1 point: Correctly updating a 4-bit array dependent on the inputs  
1 point: Drawing one box on the screen  
1 point: Description of how the DAC on the provided VGA connectors works and how the resistor values were chosen.  
4 points: Mapping external inputs to four different outputs on the screen  
1 point: Connecting the FPGA output to the speaker  
2 points: Outputting a square wave to the speaker  
4 points: Outputting a tune of at least three different frequencies to the speaker via an 8-bit DAC

# Lab 4: Radio Communication and Map Drawing

### Objectives
* Extend work from Lab 3 to use the FLPA draw a full maze on VGA monitor
* Update VGA monitor with information received from radio
* Get robot and video controller to talk to each other to simulate actual maze information 


#### Grading
2 points: Sending information wirelessly between Arduino’s  
2 points: Sending the entire maze wirelessly  
3 points: Updating the maze array, dependent only on the updated robot information  
1 point: Displaying a full 4-by-5 grid array on the screen  
3 points: Communicating maze information from the Arduino to the FPGA  
2 points: Display the robot location on the screen  
2 points: Distinguish what sites have been visited and which haven’t on the screen

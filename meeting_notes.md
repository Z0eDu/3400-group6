# Meeting Notes

## 2017.09.01
1. Jacob and Emily set up the team website, and others got used to github so that everyone knew how to edit it.
2. We wrote our team contract together. Eric documented the contract on the website.
3. Drew was absent due to a conflict. He told us prior to the meeting, so we are okay with it.
4. Emily uploaded files on google drive.
5. Ayomi distributed work for the lab 1 report.

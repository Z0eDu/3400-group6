# Terminal Recording

For [Milestone 3](../mi3/README.md), we used ASCII art and a terminal recording program called [Asciinema](https://asciinema.org/) to record our simulation. The recording looked like this:

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/3V5Omsrkrczqsp4YI2fZJ9qUo.js" id="asciicast-3V5Omsrkrczqsp4YI2fZJ9qUo" async data-size="big"></script>

While many groups made fancy graphical systems, using ASCII art and a terminal provides an easy and fast way to visualize your algorithm. Using Asciinema is simple:

1. Install it by following the [installation instructions](https://asciinema.org/docs/installation). If you are on a Mac, the easiest way is throw [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
```shell
brew install asciinema
```
On Linux, the easiest way is through your package manager.

2. Run `asciinema auth` to configure it with your account.
3. Run `asciinema rec`, and it will start recording! Simply hit Control-D or type `exit` to stop.

Here is a terminal recording of how to make a terminal recording:

You can embed the Asciinema recording using pure HTML inside your markdown files. The once above is embedded with:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/8t8hFJ0OG0WLTixkMByWDt4WJ.js" id="asciicast-8t8hFJ0OG0WLTixkMByWDt4WJ" async data-size="big"></script>
```

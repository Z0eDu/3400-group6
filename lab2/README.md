# Lab 2: Digital Signal Processing

### Objectives
* Add sensors make analog and digital filters to interface with Arduino
* Detect a 660Hz whistle blow signifying the beginning of your maze mapping 
* Be able to detect a 7kHz IR beacon with an Arduino using the FFT library

Grading Criteria  
2 points: Correct FFT analysis  
2 points: Working amplifier circuit  
3 points: Distinguish a 660Hz tone (from tones at 585Hz and 735Hz)  
2 points: Working IR sensor circuit  
3 points: Distinguish an IR treasure blinking at 7 KHz from one blinking at 12KHz.  
3 points: Nicely merged code
